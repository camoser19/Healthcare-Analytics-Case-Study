# Healthcare-Analytics-Case-Study

This Jupyter Notebook file shows my approach for identifying a chronic condition within an employee population. The data herein is made available by CMS.gov. It's purpose, according to the CMS website, "...was created with the goal of providing a realistic set of claims data in the public domain while providing the very highest degree of protection to the Medicare beneficiariesâ€™ protected health information."  

I have used three files in my analysis covering: (1) Member Information, (2) Outpatient Claims Data and (2) Prescription Drug Events.

For the most part, the work herein follows the steps outlined in my case submission with some additional analysis using prescription drug data which I did not have room to describe in full detail.
